# J22T.github.io

I created a new one because I encountered a lot of push and pull issues
with the "10_book" folder.

This seems to have resolved all the issues because it's a "fresh" and new folder.

I went the route of cloning "downloading" (I believe that's correct) and then reinitializing the git
repository again so that if there were anything wrong with the other working tree or other branches, due to
this, it should now be up to speed. It seems like it.

Hope this works.
